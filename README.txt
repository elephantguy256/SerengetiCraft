Mod Description


Hello, avid Minecraft fan! Sometimes, in the world does the savanna biome and jungle seem boring at times? Well this mod hopes to spruce up the tropical biomes to have an incredible African experience!

We will add mobs (that fit with vanilla style mobs) and maybe new trees and villages!

In order for this mod to be a reality, we need Coders, Modelers and Textures!

Current Team:
doctor hyena 0914 ---creator, modeller and texturer
MrModder1234 ---Lead Developer
Scorpio_Cruz ---Lead Developer
lukamas233 ---modeller and texturer
crazydino1 ---modeller and texturer
taylorp16 ---texturer
